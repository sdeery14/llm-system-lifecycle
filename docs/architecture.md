# LLM Lifecycle Platform Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture for a comprehensive LLM (Large Language Model) lifecycle management platform. The platform is designed to support the complete lifecycle of LLM development, evaluation, optimization, and deployment with human-in-the-loop oversight and MLflow as the central tracking and storage system.

## Architecture Philosophy

The platform follows a **human-guided, agent-assisted** approach where:
- AI agents perform heavy computational work and systematic analysis
- Human evaluators provide oversight, strategic decisions, and quality control
- Each transition between lifecycle stages requires human approval (with future flexibility for automation)
- MLflow serves as the central repository for experiments, models, artifacts, and metadata
