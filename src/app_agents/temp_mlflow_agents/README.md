# Temporary MLflow Agent Files

This directory contains auto-generated MLflow-compatible agent files created by the Dataset Builder Agent.

These files are temporary and are automatically created when logging target agents in MLflow using the models-from-code approach.

**Note**: Files in this directory are excluded from version control (except this README and .gitignore).
